## About/Requirements

A simple demonstration showing how to use a midi controller with this API. Specifically, this script binds the sliders of a Korg NanoKontrol2 to the 8 input strips of gainlayer 0. 

In order to run this example script you will need to have setup Voicemeeter with a midi device in Menu->Midi Mapping.

This script was written for and tested with a Korg NanoKontrol2 configured in CC mode. The slider CC numbers were increased by 1, as shown:
